# MechaCar Statistical Analysis


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
With a first dataset, we ran a linear regression to predict miles per gallon (mpg). The output is as follows:

With this information, the linear regression model for our dataset is: 
  vehicle_length = 0.08mpg + 11.43 
  
When trying to determine the p-value and the r-squared value we get the following output:

The r-squared value is 0.3715 which means that roughly 30% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model. 

In addition, our p-value 2.63x 10<sup>-6</sup> which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%.

Considering this data, we can 




Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
